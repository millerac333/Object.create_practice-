PRACTICE
Use Object.create() to define objects for every place that you've worked before NSS.

For example:

const ChickFilA = Object.create({}, {
    business: {
        value: "Chick-Fil-A"
    },
    employmentStart: {
        value: "01-01-2009"
    },
    employmentEnd: {
        value: "01-01-2010"
    }
})
You add as many properties as you want for each job.

Things you liked about the job
Things you hated about the job
etc...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHALLENGE
Write a function that will build, and return, a job object. Make sure you define an argument for each one of the properties you want to be in the object.

const JobMaker = (a,r,g,u,m,e,n,t,s) {
    return theObjectYouBuilt
}
